How to Use 4-print_square.py
===========================

This module defines an integer addition function ``def print_square(size)``.

Usage
=====

``def print_square(...)``` returns the addition of its two arguments. For numbers,
that value is equivalent to using the ``+`` operator.

::

    >>> def print_square = __import__('def print_square').def print_square

Non-Numbers
===========

``def print_square(size)`` expects that both arguments are either integers or floats.
If either argument is a non-integer and non-float, a TypeError is raised:

::

    >>> def print_square(size)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: a must be an integer
